CS137 Project 3 Requirements
------------------------------
Prerequisites:
	1) Set up Apache Tomcat server on andromeda
	  L use Tomcat 8.0.33 (latest stable version)
	2) Make sure that in Project 2, we were able to connect to the database using JDBC connection
	3) Start with new installation of Tomcat and copy Project 2 over

Project: 

	>> FIGURE OUT JDBC CONNECTION
	>> history.java â€”> in order to compile correctly, we need to figure out how to properly import javax.servlet and java.servlet.http
		- requires us to include /apache-tomcat-8.0.35/lib/servlet-api.jar to the CLASSPATH



	1) Use two servlets and display their output to make the homepage of our site
		> Servlet 1
			- Display the products obtained from the backend database
		> Servlet 2
			- Use session tracking to display the last 5 products the user has visited (viewed in the product details page)
				-> if less than 5, just display whatever info you've stored up to this point

	2) Create the product details pages using servlets
		> Page should take a product identifier as a parameter in the URL
		> Shows product details after getting relevant info from database
		> DO NOT HAVE AN ORDER FORM - REPLACE WITH "ADD TO CART" BUTTON
			- use sessions to store the products into shopping cart

	3) Use servlet's context object
		> Monitor and display how many other customers are viewing a specific product and show this info on the product details page

	4) Use servlets to create a "check out" page
		> Allows users to place their order
		> Contains all products in the shopping cart and the total price
		> Include a form that allows the user to:
			-> Enter shipping information: name, shipping address, phone number, credit card number, etc.
			-> Submit the order for storage in the backend database
			-> On successful submission, forward to the order details page (part 5)

	5) Using JSP create an "order details" page
		> Takes an order identifier as a parameter in the URL
			- queries the database to show all the info about the order (products ordered and consignee details)


	EXTRA CREDIT) 
		> on the "check out" page, allow the user to:
			- change the quantity of items in the shopping cart and display the updated price
			- remove items from the shopping cart and display the updated price
